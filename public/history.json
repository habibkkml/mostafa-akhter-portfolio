                "Born in Bangladesh and raised in the United States, Mostafa Mohiuddin is a businessman best known for his work in the publication sector. Though he was raised by his parents, Mostafa was most influenced by his grandfather, Mohiuddin Ahmed who was the Chairman and Founder of the publication house Khoshroz Kitab Mahal. Ahmed also founded NDC Auto Brick in an effort to produce pollution-free bricks in Bangladesh.",
                "It was through Mostafa’s work at his grandfather’s publishing company during the summers that he discovered his love for the paper industry and assumed a full-time job as Deputy Managing Director. Mostafa says he owes most of his business acumen to his grandfather, who gave him his foundational training. This knowledge, paired with his love of nature, inspired Mostafa to open a business with his brother in 2021: Magura Agriculture Park Limited. This organic agriculture farm allows a one-stop solution for people to reach farmers and fresh products with ease.",
                "Most recently, Mostafa started a new company, Khaohroz Advanced Technology Ltd. His aim is to develop the IT industry in an effort to provide smarter, better IT services, including developing software websites, networking, etc. Often described as hardworking and highly motivated, Mostafa’s current plans include expanding the operational capacity of his businesses back in his home country.",
                "In his spare time, Mostafa enjoys tending to cows, fish, and other animals. Ultimately, his goal is to give back to his hometown and make the lives of those who live there a bit easier. Mostafa wants everyone to spend more time following their passions and doing what they love, just like he does."
